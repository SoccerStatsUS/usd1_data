Philosophy of MLS




### When will MLS be top 4?

This is a question which is frequently asked in MLS communities. There are a couple of different ways to interpret this. #1 is a domestic question: the implicit "Big 4" in the United States sports landscape are NFL, MLB, NBA, NHL - the four leagues which are the most popular in the United States, and are the best in the world. A similar "Big 4" might be construed in European soccer - England, Germany, Italy, Spain - but the situation there is more fluid, with France, Netherlands, Russia, etc. and a general continuum. In the US, until MLS there was a large dropoff between other professional team sports.

What does it mean to be "top 4"? In the US 

We have already seen a move towards the idea of a "Big 5" - we can expect this to last for the foreseeable future. In a best case scenario for MLS, it approaches somewhere around the NFL's revenue - 30 teams with 30 games a year, with ancillary international revenues. It is possible on the other hand that MLS eventually plateaus or declines?

What does it mean to be in the top 4 internationally?

This is much more fluid. There are clear competitors that MLS faces in the Americas - Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, Colombia. The three big players in this game seem to be the United States, Brazil, and Mexico - Argentina and Colombia will have trouble competing with their significantly smaller populations. The United States is clearly behind Mexico at the moment, and has an ambiguous relationship with the other three.

On the international level, there are the obviously superior England, Germany, Italy, Spain, France, and Russia; Portugal, Turkey, Netherlands, Scandinavia, Ukraine face a similar situation to the Argentine and Colombian leagues. 

Africa is currently uncompetitive.

Japan and Korea are similar to Argentina.

China and India have the potential to leapfrog MLS and become the largest leagues in the world. India, China, USA, UEFA might be the "Big 4" in a distant future. "Latin America" and "Africa"; 

The strategy for MLS is clear. Become better than the other leagues, faster, and stake a claim to being the best league in the world.  




Single Entity, Salary Cap and the Future?

The fundamental advantage of single entity is not that it allows a salary cap, but that it allows MLS increased power in its relationships with its players, which allows it to enact control in how rosters are formed.

A soccer league has an interesting and varied relationship with the players and other employees of the league. cf. Marx?
